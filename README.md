# Nuclear Explosion Data

This repository contains structured data extracted from two reports:

- The Oklahoma Geological Survey Observatory’s “[Catalog of Nuclear Explosions](http://www.okgeosurvey1.gov/level2/nuke.cat.html),” updated on Oct. 9, 2006. The data extracted includes only the "Line 2" information and only rows that name a known/putative "testing party." [[structured data](data/oklahoma-catalog-explosions.csv)]

- “[Nuclear Explosions, 1945–1998](http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/31/060/31060372.pdf),” published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and Sweden's Defence Research Establishment in July, 2000. [[structured data](data/sipri-report-explosions.csv)]

For definitions of the fields, please see the [original reports](documents).

## See an error?

Because the SIPRI document was printed and then rescanned, the corresponding data may have transcription errors. I've tried to fix as many as I can find. See another? Please [file an issue](https://github.com/data-is-plural/nuclear-explosions) or email me at [jsvine@gmail.com](mailto:jsvine@gmail.com).
